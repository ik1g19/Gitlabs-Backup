# Overview

This coursework involved implementing a file transfer system using sockets in Java. The system consisted of two main components: a client and a server.

# Features


The client can send files to the server using the "put" command.

The server can retrieve files from the client using the "get" command.

Both the client and server handle incoming connections and commands, and perform file transfer operations accordingly.


# Usage

To run the coursework, simply compile the provided Java code and execute it with the necessary arguments. For example:

 
 
```java FTClient <server IP> <command> <file name>```

Replace `<server IP>` with the IP address of the server machine, `<command>` with either "put" or "get", and `<file name>` with the desired file name.
